This is the project on 'Android malware detection' through Machine learning. This folder 'CODE' contains the codes for the different machine algorithms that were tried. As of now the algorithms that were tried were:
1. Perceptron (variants: simple, margin, aggressive margin, average perceptron, average aggressive margin perceptron)
2. Decision trees
3. SVM
4. Random forest (Ensemble of decision trees with SVM)

Any algorithm 'algo' can be called using algoMain. The functions associated with the algorithm implementation is in algoFunctions. Also, there is a projectFunctions code which contains functions that are common to the algorithms. percepMain can be used to call any algorithm. 'crossValidationExperiments' contains cross validation codes for the different algorithms.

The current codes include:
1. percepMain, percepFunctions
2. treeMain, treeFunctions
3. svmMain, svmFunctions
4. ensembleMain, ensembleFunctions
5. projectMain, projectFunctions
6. crossValidationExperiments

The folder 'data' contains the data. Currently, the files in the data, eg. 'data.train' contains both the features and the labels together. The first column is the label.

To run the codes:
1) open the command window
2) type 'python algoMain.py' and press Enter.
2) Done (actually, you will have to seat for some minutes :) because the code takes time to run, and will show you the printed statements, results along the way.)
